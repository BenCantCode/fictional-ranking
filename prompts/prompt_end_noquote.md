Your task is to imagine a duel between two fictional characters.

For context, you will first be given summaries of the power systems in each characters' fictional universe. The distinctions between different types of powers will be extremely important later.

{% if franchise_a != franchise_b %}

You will now be provided with the community wiki pages for two fictional characters ({CharacterA} and {CharacterB}) in a random order. You will be asked to imagine a hypothetical one-on-one duel between these two characters, so try to determine each character's most important abilities while reading.

{{character_a.name}}

{{character_a.description}}

<article>

{{character_b.description}}

Now, imagine a duel between {{character_a.name}} and {{character_b.name}}. Assume both characters are the current versions of themselves, unless they are deceased in their universe, in which case assume they are the most well-known versions of themselves. Do not assume anything about either character that is not in their wiki page.

Respond with the following:

1.
Name and describe (in one sentence) 1 to 3 combat-related weaknesses of each character. Prioritize weaknesses that are interesting or unique in their universe.

Format this part of your response like so:

# Weaknesses
## [Character Name]
### [Weakness 1]
[Describe weakness 1.]
### [Weakness 2]
[Describe weakness 2.]
### [Weakness 3]
[Describe weakness 3.]
...
## [Other Character's Name]
[Name and describe the other character's weaknesses.]


2.
For each character, consider the three most important abilities that character possesses that would affect their performance in a one-on-one duel. If one ability can be split into multiple abilities or items, those abilities or items should be listed separately. Do not combine them into one ability. After naming an ability, describe it using three facts paraphrased from the wiki (do not quote anything directly). Next, highlight any aspects of the ability that are irrelevant to a one-on-one duel against this specific opponent by highlighting the presence or absence of something on the opponent's wiki page. Here's a hint: if the ability only effects opponents with a certain trait, and that the opponent doesn't have that trait, it is probably irrelevant. Afterwards, do the same for the parts of the ability that are relevant. Finally, write several sentences on the potential significance of the ability to the outcome of the duel, referencing only information from the facts you previously came up with.

Format this part of your response like so:

# Abilities
## [Character's Name]
### [Ability's Name]
#### Facts
"[A fact paraphrased from the character's wiki page]"
"[A fact paraphrased from the character's wiki page]"
"[A fact paraphrased from the character's wiki page]"
#### Applicability to Opponent
##### Irrelevant Aspects
[Explain which of the facts are wholly or partially irrelevant to a duel against this specific opponent using evidence from the opponent's wiki page.]
##### Relevant Aspects
[Explain which of the facts are wholly or partially relevant to a duel against this specific opponent using evidence from the opponent's wiki page.]
#### Significance
[Speculate about the ability's significance to the duel's outcome, taking into account only the aspects of the ability that are relevant to this duel.]
### [Other Ability's Name]
...
...
## [Other Character's Name]
### [Other Character's Ability's Name]
...

3. Using the significance sections in your abilities listing, create a ranking of every ability you mentioned. The ranking should be in order of the ability's likelihood to be a deciding factor in the duel. Only include the name of the ability in the ranking, not the name of the character.

Format this part of your response like so:

# Ranking (Without Names)
1. [Name of most significant ability]
2. [Name of 2nd most significant ability]
3. [Name of 3rd most significant ability]
4. [Name of 4th most significant ability]
5. [Name of 5th most significant ability]
6. [Name of 6th most significant ability]

4. Rewrite your ranking by adding the character's name next to each ability.

Format this part of your response like so:

# Ranking (With Names)
[Number]. [Ability Name] ([Character Name])
...

5. If these characters have fought previously, provide a brief summary of how the battle went. Next, reason about whether the results of the battle have any significance on the versions of the characters taking part in this duel. Was the battle a one-on-one duel? Have the characters changed sufficiently for the outcome to be affected?

Format this part of your response like so:

# Prior Battles
[Describe one or more prior battles between the two characters. If no prior battles have taken place, write "N/A".]

6. Based solely on the prior battle descriptions, lists of abilities and weaknesses, and abilities ranking, determine which character would be most likely to win in a hypothetical duel. Be realistic. Finalize your response by indicating the result:

# Winner: [Character Name]
The winner of the hypothetical duel would be [Character Name]. [Explain how you came to this conclusion.]

This system does not support follow-up questions. Follow the prompt outlined above exactly.
